              <h5 id="list-item-12">License </h5>
              <p>
                You're under no obligation to choose a license. However, without a license, the default copyright laws apply, meaning that you retain all rights to your content and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work. Nonetheless, if you wish to change the default license, please make an informed decision. We display the license information to help users get information about the content. We hope it helps, but please keep in mind that we’re not lawyers and that we make mistakes like everyone else. For that reason, Odaaay provides the information on an "as-is" basis and makes no warranties regarding any information or licenses provided on or through it, and disclaims liability for damages resulting from using the license information. If you have any questions regarding the right license for your code or any other legal issues relating to it, it’s always best to consult with a professional.

Under the DMCA, we will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, users and account holders of our system and network who are repeat infringers.</p>
              <p style='margin-right:0cm;margin-left:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;margin:0cm;text-align:justify;'>However, we also recognize that not every takedown notice is valid or in good faith. In such cases, we strongly encourage users to file counter-notifications when they appropriately believe a DMCA takedown demand is invalid or improper. For more information on what to do if you think a DMCA notice has been improperly filed, you may wish to consult the Chilling Effects website.</p>
              <p style='margin-right:0cm;margin-left:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;margin:0cm;text-align:justify;'>If you are the owner of content that is being improperly used on one of the Projects without your permission, you may request that the content be removed under the DMCA.
